            <h1>Lost and Found Box</h1>
            <p>My project was motivated by a friend who had trouble finding their glasses in the morning. I felt challenged to design a solution for people with impaired vision to not only have a consistent place to put their items, but have it be easily identified with visiual cues. This solution became the Lost and Found Box: a 3D printed box that is wrapped by an LED strip. </p>
